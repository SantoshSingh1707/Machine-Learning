## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SantoshSingh1707/Machine-Learning.git
   cd Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   _If `requirements.txt` is not available, you can manually install:_
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
